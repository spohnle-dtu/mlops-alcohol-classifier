# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We managed dependencies using standard Python pip requirments files. To run the core runtime dependencies for training, evaluation, and the FastAPI backend were placed in requirements.txt, while data/versioning dependencies were placed into requirements_dvc.txt (for DVC and the chosen remote storage). This split keeps the base environment lightweight while still supporting reproducible data and model retrieval.
To recreate the exact environment, a new team member clones the repository, creates an isolated virtual environment, installs dependencies from both requirements files, and then pulls the versioned data/models with DVC. In addition, since we log experiments to Weights & Biases, the member must be invited to our W&B entity/project and authenticate locally before running training.

An example would be:

git clone <repo-url>
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_dvc.txt
dvc pull
wandb login



### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:
> We started out using the Cookiecutter tempate given by: https://github.com/SkafteNicki/mlops_template, and mostly adhered to that structure. The src/ directory was filled with the core runtime code, including data preprocessing, dataset handling, model definition, training, evaluation, and a FastAPI-based inference API. This is where most of the project-specific logic lives. We made small test scripts in test folder. We added small, focused test scripts in the tests/ folder to validate key components such as data loading, model behavior, and the API. Configuration files are stored in the configs/ directory and managed with Hydra, as intended by the template.

In addition to the original structure, we introduced dedicated dockerfiles/ and frontend/ folders to support containerized deployment and a simple Streamlit-based frontend. Finally, the checkpoints/ directory is tracked with DVC and used to store the best-performing trained model.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We implemented several rules and tools to ensure code quality and readability throughout the project. We used Ruff as our primary tool for both linting and formatting. Ruff ensures a consistent coding style and detects if there are any unused imports, undefined variables, and other issues which help catching bugs early on in the development and reduces redundancy.

Additionally, we made use of Python type hints in function signatures and class definitions to make it easier to understand the inputs required, and the expected outputs. Type annotations are used in the core parts of the pipeline (data loading, model interfaces, and training loops), making the code easier to reason about and less error-prone, but it is not necessairly everywhere. The same applies for inline comments that we used to describe parts of the code.

These kind of practices and tools are crucial in bigger projects where multiple developers work together. Consistent formatting, linting, and tracking unsued parts of the code, ensures structure and readability of code. It also makes it easier for co-developers to read and understand changes. In general, these practices lowers the barrier for new contributors, and easies the integration of new code.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We implemented three test modules (test_data.py, test_model.py, and test_api.py) which were mainly used in the begginning og the project. For FastAPI, the API tests validate the /health endpoint to ensure the service is running correctly, and the /predict endpoint to confirm it accepts image uploads and returns a valid prediction response with class labels and probabilities.In addition, we used Weights & Biases (W&B) to log training and evaluation metrics, which helps identify regressions and monitor the impact of code and data changes over time.


### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

Our total code coverage is 28%. Coverage can be used as an indicator that our core modules (data.py, model.py, train.py etc) are exercised automatically, and that changes that we might do will not silently break the functionality or core modules.

We would never trust a code to be completely error-free even though the coverage is 100%. A coverage of 100% tells us that all our lines were executed, but not necessarily that they are tested with the right edge cases or guarentee that the logic in our code was validated in a meaningfull way.

Doing an API test and calling the /predict endpoint with a valid response, might still overlook problems with mismatching of class labels, or preporcessing which is inconsistent etc. Moreover, training code might execute error-free while still hiding problems with correct metrics or reproducebility. Thus, reliability also depends on well-designed tests, continous monitoring and loggin with wandb for instance, and evaluation of real data.

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

We made use of Branches in this project, each member had their own branch to work on with new functionality. To commit new code, the main branch was first pulled to get the latest updates and then merged into the member's branch to resolve any conflicts. Then a clean merge was done into the main branch.
Prs was not used in this project, but could've been used to allow other group members to review the code before commiting it, ensuring higher code quality and fewer bugs by suggesting improvements.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**

> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We used DVC to manage data and model artifacts in the project, e.g. DVC was used to track the raw data ona Google Drive folder, instead of committing large datasets and trained models directly to Git. This helped keep the repository clean and lightweight while still allowing us to version control important data outputs such as processed datasets and the best model checkpoint.

Using DVC made our collaboration efforts easier, since everyone on the team could pull the same data and model versions with dvc pull, reducing confusion about which data was used for training and evaluation. It also helped with reproducibility, as each Git commit is linked to a specific data state. It initially added some extra setup and commands, but overall DVC improved the structure and reliability of our ML workflow.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We configured experiments using Hydra config files stored in the configs/ folder (e.g., dataset paths, batch size, learning rate, epochs, and model settings). This made it easy to reproduce runs and override parameters from the command line without changing code. For example, a default training run is started with:

python -m src.alcohol_classifier.train

and a modified experiment can be launched by overriding config values:

python -m src.alcohol_classifier.train model.lr=1e-3 model.epochs=20 dataset.batch_size=128


### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

We ensured reproducibility by making use of config management, data versioning, and experiment logging. 

Our experiment configurations are defined through Hydra config files, so hyperparameters, dataset paths, and model settings are explicitly specified and not hard-coded. For datapaths, we made sure to always define paths from the root folder. When an experiment is run, Hydra automatically saves the fully resolved configuration to the output directory, ensuring that the exact setup of each run is preserved.

For version control we used DVC for data and model checkpoints, which allows us to tie experiment with a specific data and model state. In addition, training and evaluation metrics are logged using Weights & Biases (W&B), providing a persistent record of results and metadata. 

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:

![wandb_1](figures/wand_1.png)
![wandb_3](figures/wand_2.png)
![wandb_2](figures/wand_3.png)

The screenshots above show experiments that were tracked using Weights & Biases (W&B) while training and validating our alcohol classification model.
In the first image, we track training loss and training accuracy across epochs. The training loss drops quickly and the accuracy increases to almost 100%, which shows that the model is learning the training data effectively and that the optimization setup works as intended.

The second image shows validation loss and validation accuracy. These metrics are important because they tell us how well the model performs on data it has not seen during training. While the validation accuracy stays fairly stable around 92–93%, the validation loss fluctuates slightly. Comparing training and validation metrics helps us identify overfitting and decide whether changes such as regularization or fewer epochs are needed.
In the third image, we log system-level metrics, such as GPU clock speed during training. These metrics are useful for understanding hardware performance, comparing runs on different machines, and explaining differences in training time. They also help with debugging performance issues when running experiments on GPUs.

Overall, W&B allows us to keep track of metrics, hyperparameters, and experiment history in one place. This makes it easier to compare runs, reproduce results, and understand how different configuration choices affect both model performance and training efficiency.

> Example:

> *to the API to make it more ...*
>
> Answer:
> 
We built an API for our trained model using FastAPI. The idea was to make the model accessible as a small web service that can run predictions. The PyTorch model is loaded once when the API starts from the saved checkpoint (best.pt), so it doesn’t need to be reloaded for every request, which keeps things faster.
The API has two main endpoints. The /health endpoint is a simple check to see if the service is up and whether the model loaded correctly. This is mainly useful when deploying the service, for example on Cloud Run, to make sure everything is running as expected. The /predict endpoint is where the actual inference happens. It takes an uploaded image, applies the same preprocessing as during training (resizing and normalization), and returns the predicted class together with the model’s confidence for each class.

### Question 24

> **Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and**
> **preferably how you invoke your deployed service?**

>
> Answer:

Yes, we deployed our API both locally and in the cloud. We started by running the FastAPI service locally to check that everything worked as intended, such as loading the model correctly and returning predictions. After that, we packaged the API together with the trained model into a Docker container, which we then tried to deploy to the Google Cloud platform.
